I can help you enhance the glow effect for the image container in dark mode to make it more pronounced. Let's modify the CSS to create a stronger, more visible glow effect:

```css:src/app/globals.css
/* Enhanced image container with gradient border */
.image-container-enhanced {
  @apply relative rounded-2xl overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 
              0 5px 15px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  border: 1px solid rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.2);
}

.image-container-enhanced:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: 0 15px 40px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15), 
              0 10px 20px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border: 1px solid rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.3);
}

.dark .image-container-enhanced {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4), 
              0 5px 15px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2),
              0 0 0 1px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.4),
              0 0 30px 5px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.25);
  border: 1px solid rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.5);
}

.dark .image-container-enhanced:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 15px 40px -10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), 
              0 10px 20px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3),
              0 0 0 2px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.6),
              0 0 40px 8px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.35);
  border: 1px solid rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.7);
}

/* Inner container for the image */
.image-container-enhanced .image-inner {
  @apply absolute inset-0 rounded-2xl overflow-hidden z-10;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.1);
}

.dark .image-container-enhanced .image-inner {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.4),
              inset 0 0 20px 0 rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.15);
}

.dark .image-container-enhanced:hover .image-inner {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.5),
              inset 0 0 25px 0 rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.25);
}

.image-container-enhanced::before {
  content: "";
  @apply absolute inset-0 rounded-2xl -m-1 blur-xl opacity-60 dark:opacity-80 transition-opacity;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.3), rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.3));
}

.image-container-enhanced:hover::before {
  @apply opacity-80 dark:opacity-100;
}

.image-container-enhanced::after {
  content: "";
  @apply absolute inset-0 rounded-2xl p-[1px] overflow-hidden;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(20, 184, 166, 0.4), rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4));
  z-index: 0;
}

.dark .image-container-enhanced::before {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.6), rgba(96, 165, 250, 0.6));
  filter: blur(16px);
  margin: -2px;
}

.dark .image-container-enhanced::after {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(45, 212, 191, 0.8), rgba(96, 165, 250, 0.8));
}
```
I've enhanced the glow effect for the image container in dark mode to make it more pronounced. Here are the specific changes I made:

### Enhanced Dark Mode Glow Effect

1. **Increased Glow Intensity**:
   - Increased the glow radius from 20px to 30px (and from 25px to 40px on hover)
   - Increased the glow opacity from 0.15 to 0.25 (and from 0.25 to 0.35 on hover)
   - Made the border thicker on hover (from 1px to 2px) with higher opacity

2. **Improved Gradient Effects**:
   - Increased the opacity of the gradient overlays (from 0.7 to 0.8 for normal state)
   - Increased the opacity to 1.0 on hover for maximum glow effect
   - Added a stronger blur filter (16px) to the before pseudo-element
   - Increased the margin of the blur effect to -2px to extend it further beyond the container

3. **Enhanced Inner Shadow**:
   - Increased the inner glow from 15px to 20px (and from 20px to 25px on hover)
   - Increased the opacity of the inner border from 0.3 to 0.4 (and from 0.4 to 0.5 on hover)

4. **Stronger Border Contrast**:
   - Increased border opacity from 0.4 to 0.5 (and from 0.6 to 0.7 on hover)
   - Made the gradient colors more vibrant (from 0.5/0.7 to 0.6/0.8)

These changes create a much more pronounced glow effect in dark mode that makes the image container really stand out. The glow is now more visible and creates a stronger visual impact while still maintaining a tasteful, professional look.

You can further customize the glow effect by adjusting these values:

1. To make the glow even more intense, you could:
   - Increase the blur radius in the `filter: blur(16px)` property
   - Increase the glow spread in the `0 0 40px 8px` shadow property (the 8px value)
   - Increase the opacity values in the gradient backgrounds

2. To change the color of the glow:
   - Adjust the color values in the gradients (currently using teal and blue)
   - You could make it a single color by using the same color for both sides of the gradient

Would you like me to make any further adjustments to the glow effect?
