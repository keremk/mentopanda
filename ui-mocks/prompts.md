# Instructions: 
As a manager, you will be confronted with a communication problem of one of your direct reports. Let's call him John. John has missed a few of his commitments in the last 2 weeks. He did not update his team that he was struggling and was going to miss those and team members who depended on them were not able to deliver the feature on time. In a recent standup, one of the team members (say Jane) confronted him and tried to give him feedback but John acted defensively, got very upset and did not even let the other person finish their feedback. Jane came to you and explained this situation. Now in this scenario, you need to bring this up to John in the 1:1 meeting and give him constructive feedback on how he should behave next time. 

## John's background:
John is a backend engineer who joined your team 2 years ago. He has been a good performer but not a stellar one. He is a reserved person. He does not talk too much. So it is a challenge to get good information from him sometimes. 

## Jane's background:
Jane is also a backend engineer who has been with your team for 3 years. She is one of your top performers and very honest and thrustworthy in general. 

## Your challenge:
Our assessment will analyse your conversation on these points:
* How do you bring up the topic? Is it clear?
* Did you also actively listen and get a full picture by asking the right questions?
* What your specific feedback is?
