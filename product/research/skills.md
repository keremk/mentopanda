Below is a **single‑tier, more universal skill set**—still expressed as five percentile “stats,” but abstracted so they can map onto almost any professional setting. Under each, I’ve kept the two perspectives you liked:

* **What it governs** (what a low roll lets the agent do well)
* **Typical failure modes** (what shows up in software‑engineering conversations when the roll is high / the skill misses)

| #     | Generalised skill (d100)      | What it governs                                                                                                          | Typical failure modes in software‑engineering contexts                                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Emotional Intelligence**    | Sensing mood, showing empathy, choosing supportive language, regulating one’s own tone.                                  | ↯ Misreads frustration or burnout signals; responds too coolly to bad news; escalates tension instead of defusing it.              |
| **2** | **Conceptual Clarity**        | Explaining ideas at the right altitude—code, architecture, product vision—so the audience “gets it” quickly.             | ↯ Dives into jargon with non‑eng peers; stays vague about tech debt; leaves designers or PMs unsure what’s feasible.               |
| **3** | **Strategic Framing**         | Tying day‑to‑day work to bigger goals (OKRs, user outcomes, revenue, mission) and spotting misalignment early.           | ↯ “We built it because it was cool”; implements tickets without questioning value; can’t defend a trade‑off to leadership.         |
| **4** | **Collaborative Negotiation** | Surfacing constraints, exploring options, building consensus, and preserving relationships under time or scope pressure. | ↯ All‑or‑nothing stance on deadlines; agrees to everything then slips; bends on quality without flagging risk; causes scope creep. |
| **5** | **Directive Facilitation**    | Guiding conversations, keeping focus, summarising decisions, assigning next steps, and closing loops.                    | ↯ Meetings run long; no clear owner or due date; action items forgotten; stand‑ups become status monologues.                       |

### How to use them in your BRP‑style loop

1. **Set baseline percentages** for your agent (e.g., junior engineer may have high Conceptual Clarity but lower Strategic Framing).
2. **Roll d100 for each skill (or once and compare)** before each response.
3. **Let the highest successful skill shape the voice**—tone, structure, vocabulary—while answering.
4. **If all fail**, the agent replies neutrally *and* surfaces uncertainty (“I might be missing context—could you clarify X?”).

Because the skills are broad, you can fine‑tune them per persona or scenario without changing the overall framework:

* Coaching an intern? Boost Emotional Intelligence and Directive Facilitation.
* Aligning with a PM on roadmap? Raise Strategic Framing and Collaborative Negotiation.
* Deep‑dive architecture review? Prioritise Conceptual Clarity.

This single layer keeps the sheet small, yet each skill still maps cleanly onto concrete behaviours you—and your users—will recognise in everyday software‑engineering conversations.
