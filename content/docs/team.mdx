MentoPanda allows you to invite team members to your projects and assign them different roles. This is useful for creating tailored training programs for your team. You can also manage your team's progress and performance. 

## Inviting Team Members
You can invite team members to your project by navigating to the Team page.

Once you are on the Team page, you will see a button labeled "Invite". Click on this button to open the invitation dialog.

In the invitation dialog, you can enter the email address of the person you want to invite. You can also select their role in the project from the dropdown menu. The available roles are Admin, Manager, and Member. You can find the description of those roles in the [Projects](./projects) section. After entering the email addresses and selecting the roles, click on the "Send Invite" button to send the invitation.

## Managing Team Members
Once you have invited team members, you can manage them from the Team page. You will see a list of all the members in your project along with their roles. You can change their roles by selecting a different role from the dropdown menu next to their name. You can also remove a member from the project by clicking on the "Remove" button.

<Callout type="warning">
  If you give manager or admin access to a team member, they will also be able to see other team members' information. As a rule of thumb, each project will have an admin (who might be the team lead or manager) and the rest of the team members will be members. You might want to give manager access to your own manager or a People/HR partner.

## Team Member Progress
You can also view the progress of your team members in the Team page. You will see a progress heatmap that highlights their activity over the last 3 months. You will also see a list of their recent trainings and you can click on a training to view their assessment results. This is useful especially in 1:1 sessions to review the performance of your team members and provide feedback.
