MentoPanda allows you to engage in role-playing conversations with AI characters to practice and improve your communication skills. This feature is designed to simulate real-life scenarios where you can interact with various characters, receive immediate feedback, and refine your approach.

## Getting Started
To start a role-playing conversation, you will first need to enroll in a training program that includes role-playing scenarios as modules. You can enroll in trainings from the trainings section where you can find on the sidebar. You can peruse the available trainings in "My Trainings" or find new public trainings in the "Publics Trainings" tab. If you find a training that interests you, simply click on the "Join" button to join.

<Callout type="info">
For public trainings, you need to first add them to your projects before you can join them. You can do this by clicking the "Add to Project" button.

You can find your enrolled trainings either in the "Home" section as seen below:

Or alternatively in the "Enrollments" section, which shows you a more detailed view of your enrolled trainings as well as the history of your completed trainings.

You can start a random module of a training by clicking the "Start Random Module" button, or you can click select the module you want to start by clicking the "Start Module" button.

## Preparing for Role-Playing
Once you selected a module, MentoPanda will provide you an opportunity to prepare for the role-playing conversation. This is so that you can familiarize yourself with the scenario and prepare some notes for the conversation. We highly recommend you to take advantage of this preparation time to ensure a more effective role-playing experience.

You can interact with the MentoPanda, your AI coach, to get guidance and tips on how to approach the conversation. The AI coach will provide you with insights and suggestions based on the scenario and character you will be interacting with. She will also take notes for you based on your inputs, which will be available to you during the role-playing conversation.

Once MentoPanda has gathered enough information, you can proceed to training by clicking on the "End Session & Continue" button. You will be prompted to save the notes so you can refer to them during the conversation.

## Role-Playing Conversation
After the preparation, you will enter the role-playing conversation with the AI character. The AI will take on the role of the character in the scenario, and you will interact with it as you would in a real-life situation.

On the right side of the screen, you will see the instructions, notes you took during the preparation along with some tips from MentoPanda and also the live transcription of the conversation.

<Callout type="warning">
Live transcription can be inaccurate at times and may be different from what the AI actually understood. Live transcription is created separately from the AI's direct speech recognition system. If you notice that the live transcription is significantly different from what you said, we recommend you to switch to typing your responses. Live transcription is used for the assessment of your performance after the conversation.

In the conversation box on the right, you will see a duration timer and 2 buttons to customize the behavior of the AI character. You can adjust the duration of the conversation before you start by clicking on the up/down arrows next to the timer.

The 2 buttons will allow you to change the skill levels and traits of the character so you can practice different types of characters with varying skill levels and traits. You can click on the buttons to open a dialog to select the skill levels and traits you want to apply to the character. Once you are happy with your selection, click on the "Apply" button to apply the changes. These will pop up the same dialogs you see when you [create or edit](./create-trainings) a character in the training module.

You can start your conversation when you are ready by clicking the "Start Conversation" button. During the conversation, you can speak as you would normally in a real conversation. The AI will respond to you based on the scenario and the character it is portraying. You can also choose to type your responses if you prefer. It is useful especially if the AI is having trouble understanding your speech (can be mainly due to accent or background noise).

<Callout type="info">
We recommend using a good quality microphone for the best experience. If you are using a laptop, make sure to be in a quiet environment to minimize background noise.

You can end the conversation at any time by clicking the "End Conversation" button. Once the conversation ends, you will receive feedback on your performance, including areas of improvement and suggestions for future conversations.

## Conversation Assessment Report
After the role-playing conversation, MentoPanda will generate a detailed assessment report based on your performance. The report will be based on the assessment instructions provided in the module. If you have admin or manager access to the project, you can customize the assessment instructions in the module settings.
