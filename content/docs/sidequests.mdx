Sometimes, you might want to create a quick impromptu exercise to prepare for a specific situation. May be it is a quick pitch you need to make in your next meeting, a negotation to get the best price for a product you are planning to buy or a preparation on how to bring up the promotion topic with your manager. Sidequests are designed to help you with these quick exercises. You can create a sidequest in just a few minutes and start practicing right away.

## Creating a Sidequest
On the home page, you will see a button labeled "Go Panda". Click on this button to start creating a new sidequest.

This will launch into the sidequest creation flow. You should start the conversation with MentoPanda by clicking the "Start Conversation" button. MentoPanda will guide you through the sidequest creation process by asking you a series of questions. Make sure to provide clear and concise answers to help MentoPanda understand your needs. You can also provide additional context or details to help MentoPanda create a more tailored sidequest for you.

Once you have provided all the necessary information, MentoPanda will generate a sidequest for you. You can then start the sidequest by clicking the "Continue" button. This will take you to the conversation interface where you can start practicing. This is the same interface as the role-playing conversations, so you can refer to the [Role Playing Conversations](./role-playing) documentation for more details on how to use the interface.

You can view and manage your sidequests in a special training created with Sidequest modules. You can find this training in the "My Trainings" section on the home page. Click on the "My Trainings" tab to see a list of all your trainings, including the Sidequests training.
