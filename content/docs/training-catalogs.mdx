In MentoPanda, trainings can be private to you, to you and the people in your project, or public to everyone.

## Public Trainings

These are trainings that anyone can access. They are published by users using MentoPanda and can be copied (i.e. forked) to your current project as long as you are a manager or admin of that project. You can find these trainings in the trainings section of the side panel and under the "Public Trainings" tab.

In order to use these trainings, you should first add them to your project. This will copy (fork) the training in your current project. Once it is copied, you can then use it in your role playing conversations or also edit it to suit your needs.

Once a training is copied to your project, you can choose to recopy it by selecting "Add Again" button. This will create a new copy of the training in your project. This is useful if you want to get a new version of the training, for example if the original training has been updated by the author.

## Private Trainings

These are trainings that are only visible to you and the people in your project. You can create your own trainings and they will be private by default. You can also copy (fork) public trainings to your project, which will make them private to you and your project members. Any changes you make after copying the private training will not affect the original public training and will only be visible to you and your project members.

## Enrollments

You can join these trainings by selecting the "Join" button. This will add the training to your enrollments and make it available for you to use in your role playing conversations. You can view your enrolled trainings in the "Enrollments" section of the side panel.

Once you are enrolled in a training, you can use it in your role playing conversations. You can also leave the training by selecting the "Leave" button, which will remove it from your enrollments. In the "Enrollments" section, you can also see the progress you have made.
