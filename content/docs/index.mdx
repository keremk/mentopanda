# Welcome to MentoPanda

MentoPanda is an AI-powered platform designed to help you develop better communication and people management skills through role-playing scenarios. You can use the publicly available trainings, trainings prepared by your organization in private projects or create your own trainings in your own projects.

## Why MentoPanda

Communication skills is something we often learn on the fly as we encounter different situations. Unfortunately if we don't get good feeback, it is something very hard to improve on. Getting good feedback depends on how good our mentors, managers are, or how honest and open they are in providing constructive feedback (which is often times hard feedback). We designed MentoPanda so you can simulate situations and the different types of characters you may encounter in those situations. This way you can role play as many times as you want and immediately after the role play, let AI analyse your encounter and provide you honest and immediate feedback on how to improve. This happens all in the privacy of you and your helpful MentoPanda AI. There is no reason to be worried about being ashamed or doing the wrong things. We think AI opens up this immense possibility to improve your communication skills which has never existed before its invention.

There are other alternatives that many companies try to provide through coaching and management training courses and workshops. However these alternatives fall a bit short, because although they are very good at teaching the theory and fundamentals, the opportunities to exercise these in given situations are very limited. They may provide a few short pairings with your colleagues during the workshop to roleplay but first these are very short and depend a lot on the other person's ability to role play and second you usually don't get expert feedback on how you performed. The instructor may pick one or two groups but if you are not lucky than you will not really get any feedback.
