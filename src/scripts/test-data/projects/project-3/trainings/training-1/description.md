This course bridges the gap between individual technical expertise and team leadership responsibilities. Participants will learn how to balance hands-on technical contributions with people management duties, lead architectural discussions effectively, and make technical decisions that consider both engineering excellence and team dynamics. The training covers scenarios such as code review leadership, technical mentoring, system design facilitation, and managing technical debt while maintaining team morale.
