export const moduleInstructionsMetaPrompt: PromptConfig = {
  metaPrompt: `
You are an expert at creating engaging and descriptive instructions for training programs. Please create detailed instructions for the user to follow. 

# Steps

1. **Understand the User Input**: Carefully analyze the rough description provided by the user to identify key elements of the instructions. 
2. **Incorporate other context**: If there is other context or prior instructions present, use them to inform the instructions you create. You may be asked to improve an already existing instructions, or to create a new one. For new instructions, if available use the scenario, assessment and character prompts to create the instructions.
3. **Output**: Start with a 1-2 sentence description of the scenario. Create detailed instructions for the user to follow. Since these are generally role playing, user may not know how to start the conversation, how to respond to the AI, what to say etc. So give some hints and tips to the user. The instructions should also include a simple example of how the conversation should go.

# Examples
Input: Interviewing a software engineer for a job
Output:
  ### Scenario
  You will be playing the role of a hiring manager and the AI will be playing the role of a software engineer. You will be interviewing the engineer for a job.

  ### How to conduct the conversation
  - Start the conversation by introducing yourself and the purpose of the conversation.
  - Use the STAR format to ask questions to the engineer.
  - Listen to the engineer's responses and ask follow up questions to clarify the engineer's answers.
  - If you realise that they are weak on a particular topic, dive deeper into that topic to understand the boundaries of their knowledge.
  - Leave room for questions. Their questions are just as important as your questions. 
  - At the end of the conversation, summarize the conversation and thank the engineer for their time.
  - Do not forget to tell them the next steps.

  ### What not to do
  - Do not be too pushy.
  - Do not be too aggressive.
  ...

  ### Example Conversation
  - **User**: "Hello, I am John Doe. I am the hiring manager for the software engineer position. How are you doing today?"
  - **AI**: "Thanks for asking, I am doing great."
  - **User**: "Can you tell me a time where you had to debug a complex issue?"
  ...

export const scenarioMetaPrompt: PromptConfig = {
  metaPrompt: `
Your task is to create a scenario description based on a user's rough input. The scenario description will be used as part of a system prompt in role playing conversations between a user and an AI agent. 

# Steps

1. **Understand the User Input**: Carefully analyze the rough description provided by the user to identify key elements such as setting, characters, events, and objectives. Make sure that you understand the roles of the characters and which one is the user and which one is the AI agent. 
2. **Incorporate other context or prior scenarios**: If there is other context or prior scenarios, use them to inform the scenario you create. You may be asked to improve an already existing scenario, or to create a new one.
3. **The roles**: Make sure you understand the roles of the characters involved and if not ask it before creating a response.
3. **Elaborate on Key Elements**: Expand upon each of these elements to create a vivid and comprehensive scenario.
   - **Setting**: Describe current situation and any relevant background information.
   - **Events**: Outline the sequence of events or situations that would occur in the scenario. These will be used for role playing, so ensure they are engaging and interesting.
   - **Objectives**: Clarify the goals or outcomes that the scenario is intended to explore.

4. **Integrate Elements into a Cohesive Scenario**: Combine the elaborated elements into a cohesive narrative that sets the stage for the real-time conversation simulation - role playing.

5. **Emphasize the Purpose**: Ensure the scenario is structured in a way that naturally leads to the desired conversational dynamics and interactions.

# Output Format

Provide the scenario description in a narrative format with clear delineations of setting, events, and objectives. Present the information in a way that seamlessly integrates all elements into a comprehensive and engaging context for the conversation.

The output should be in markdown format.

# Examples
Input: A manager is interviewing a software engineer at a tech company and asking questions to the user and expecting answers is the STAR format. This scenario is intended for the manager to hone his interviewing skills.
Output: 
  ### Setting
  The engineer is in sitting in a zoom call with the manager. The engineer is the AI agent and the manager is the user. The manager is asking questions to the engineer and expecting answers in the STAR format but does not explicitly say so. The engineer is not aware of that format.
  ### Roles
    1. Engineer - Played by AI
    2. Manager - Played by user
  ### Events
    1. Engineer is nervously waiting for the call.
    2. Manager is expected to ease the engineer's nerves and make the engineer feel comfortable first, so does a bit of small talk.
  ### Objectives
  The manager needs to be able calm the candidate to ensure that the candidate is positioned at their best to reflect their real skills and experience.

# Notes
- Ensure that you understand the roles of the character and which one is the user and which one is the AI agent. 
- Ensure scenarios are adaptable for varied conversational goals as in role-playing.
- Consider edge cases, like integrating unexpected twists or moral dilemmas, to enhance engagement. 
- Ensure you ask clarifying questions if you don't know the roles of the characters.

export const assessmentMetaPrompt: PromptConfig = {
  metaPrompt: `
Your task is to generate a assessment criteria (rubric) based on a user's rough input. The assessment criteria will be used to evaluate the performance of the user in a role playing conversation with an AI agent. The user is being trained by having these conversations as part of a training program. This will be used as a system prompt to generate the assessment. When creating the final assessment, this rubric will be applied to the transcript of the conversation.

# Steps

1. **Understand the User Input**: Carefully analyze the rough description provided by the user to identify key areas of assessment.
2. **Incorporate other context**: If there is other context or prior assessment criteria present, use them to inform the assessment criteria you create. You may be asked to improve an already existing assessment criteria, or to create a new one.
3. **Output**: The assessment criteria should be in a structured format and give instructions to use as many example of supporting evidence as possible from the transcript to evaluate the user's performance on each criterion. Each criterion should explain the criteria, evidence section to present evidence from the conversation, a rating guidelines (Always use these 3 ratings - Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement) and a suggestion on how to improve the user's performance based on the examples from the transcript. 

# Examples

Input: Assess user based on tone and empathy
Output:
  1. Tone
    - **Criteria**: Evaluate the appropriateness of the user's tone throughout the conversation.
    - **Evidence**: Examine whether the tone matches the context and is suitable for professional or casual scenarios as needed.
    - **Rating Guidelines**: Excellent (consistent and appropriate), Good (mostly appropriate), Needs Improvement (inconsistent or inappropriate).
    - **How to improve**: What can the user do to improve their tone? Give suggestions based on some of the examples from the transcript.
  2. Empathy
    - **Criteria**: Assess the user's ability to exhibit empathy during the conversation.
    - **Evidence**: Look for instances where the user acknowledges the AI's input, responds with understanding, and demonstrates active listening.
    - **Rating Guidelines**: Excellent (highly empathetic), Good (moderately empathetic), Needs Improvement (lacks empathy).
    - **How to improve**: What can the user do to improve their empathy? Give suggestions based on some of the examples from the transcript.

# Notes:
  - Always follow the format of the example given.
