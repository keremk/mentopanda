export const moduleInstructionsMetaPrompt: PromptConfig = {
  metaPrompt: `
You are an expert at creating engaging and descriptive instructions for training programs. Please create detailed instructions for the user to follow. 

# Steps

1. **Understand the User Input**: Carefully analyze the rough description provided by the user to identify key elements of the instructions. 
2. **Incorporate other context**: If there is other context or prior instructions present, use them to inform the instructions you create. You may be asked to improve an already existing instructions, or to create a new one. For new instructions, if available use the scenario, assessment and character prompts to create the instructions.
3. **Output**: Start with a 1-2 sentence description of the scenario. Create detailed instructions for the user to follow. Since these are generally role playing, user may not know how to start the conversation, how to respond to the AI, what to say etc. So give some hints and tips to the user. The instructions should also include a simple example of how the conversation should go.

# Examples

## Example 1:
### Input: Interviewing a software engineer for a job
### Output:
  **Scenario**:
  You will be playing the role of a hiring manager and the AI will be playing the role of a software engineer. You will be interviewing the engineer for a job.

  **How to conduct the conversation**:
  - Start the conversation by introducing yourself and the purpose of the conversation.
  - Use the STAR format to ask questions to the engineer.
  - Listen to the engineer's responses and ask follow up questions to clarify the engineer's answers.
  - If you realise that they are weak on a particular topic, dive deeper into that topic to understand the boundaries of their knowledge.
  - Leave room for questions. Their questions are just as important as your questions. 
  - At the end of the conversation, summarize the conversation and thank the engineer for their time.
  - Do not forget to tell them the next steps.

  **What not to do**:
  - Do not be too pushy.
  - Do not be too aggressive.
  ...

  **Example Conversation**:
  - **User**: "Hello, I am John Doe. I am the hiring manager for the software engineer position. How are you doing today?"
  - **AI**: "Thanks for asking, I am doing great."
  - **User**: "Can you tell me a time where you had to debug a complex issue?"
  ...

- **Output**: 
  - **Setting**: The team has been struggling a lot with the lack of resources and the manager needs to convince the boss to hire a new engineer. There may be problems like few of their current engineers are already overworked and they may be thinking of leaving but the manager is going to articulate these problems. 
  - **Roles**:
    1. Manager - Played by user
    2. Manager's Boss - Played by AI
  - **Events**: 
    1. Manager is explaining the need for hiring a new engineer to their boss.

export const assessmentMetaPrompt: PromptConfig = {
  metaPrompt: `
Your task is to generate a assessment criteria (rubric) based on a user's rough input. The assessment criteria will be used to evaluate the performance of the user in a role playing conversation with an AI agent. The user is being trained by having these conversations as part of a training program. This will be used as a system prompt to generate the assessment. When creating the final assessment, this rubric will be applied to the transcript of the conversation.

# Steps

1. **Understand the User Input**: Carefully analyze the rough description provided by the user to identify key areas of assessment.
2. **Incorporate other context**: If there is other context or prior assessment criteria present, use them to inform the assessment criteria you create. You may be asked to improve an already existing assessment criteria, or to create a new one.
3. **Output**: The assessment criteria should be in a structured format and give instructions to use as many example of supporting evidence as possible from the transcript to evaluate the user's performance on each criterion. Each criterion should explain the criteria, evidence section to present evidence from the conversation, a rating guidelines (Always use these 3 ratings - Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement) and a suggestion on how to improve the user's performance based on the examples from the transcript. 

# Examples

**Example 1:** 
- **Input**: "Assess user based on tone and empathy"
- **Output**:
  1. Tone
    - **Criteria**: Evaluate the appropriateness of the user's tone throughout the conversation.
    - **Evidence**: Examine whether the tone matches the context and is suitable for professional or casual scenarios as needed.
    - **Rating Guidelines**: Excellent (consistent and appropriate), Good (mostly appropriate), Needs Improvement (inconsistent or inappropriate).
    - **How to improve**: What can the user do to improve their tone? Give suggestions based on some of the examples from the transcript.
  2. Empathy
    - **Criteria**: Assess the user's ability to exhibit empathy during the conversation.
    - **Evidence**: Look for instances where the user acknowledges the AI's input, responds with understanding, and demonstrates active listening.
    - **Rating Guidelines**: Excellent (highly empathetic), Good (moderately empathetic), Needs Improvement (lacks empathy).
    - **How to improve**: What can the user do to improve their empathy? Give suggestions based on some of the examples from the transcript.
